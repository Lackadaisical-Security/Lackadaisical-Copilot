## Recent Critical Fixes (Phase 9) ‚úÖ

### üö® Memory Importance Scoring Bug
**Problem**: Memories were being logged with `importance: NaN` causing database NOT NULL constraint failures
**Root Cause**: Method name mismatch in `src/routes/memory.js` calling `calculateImportance` instead of `scoreImportance`

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - No more database constraint failures

### üîß Modular Dashboard Integration
**Challenge**: Implementing service-based architecture without breaking existing functionality
**Solution**: Created wrapper services that utilize existing backend systems
